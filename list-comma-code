# Say you have a list value like this:
# spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']
# Write a function that takes a list value as an argument
# and returns a string with all the items separated by a
# comma and a space, with and inserted before the last
# item. For example, passing the previous spam list to
# the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'.
# But your function should be able to work with any list value
# passed to it.

arg_spam=['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']
